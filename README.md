# gtax
My old growtopia private server, used it as project for learning c++ basics.
Main idea was creating server that will be better than Vyte's GTPS 3, unfortunately i had low skills and no vps to host my project, but still did a good job.
The PS could work for 3.63+-, have not updated it long time, i started coding it in 2019 and fully ended in 2020 or 2021.
# unique modules and logics
* Pet system
* In-game roles, levels and gems can be obtained with special WLS
* IOTM
* Custom shop and news
* Temp ban/mute
* Business system
* Casino system
# and much much more, but i cant remember it all :D
have fun with it
